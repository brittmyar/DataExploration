# DataExploration
- This project involves the use of Microsoft SQL Server for data exploration using Covid-19 data.

# Background
- The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions worldwide. The pandemic has led to a massive amount of data being generated, and analyzing this data can provide insights into the spread and impact of the virus. To gain these insights, the data needs to be cleaned and prepared for analysis.

# Approach
- To analyze Covid-19 data, Microsoft SQL Server was used to create a database, import the data into the database, and use SQL queries to perform data exploration. The following steps were taken:
- Getting the total number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths for each country
- Getting the countries with the highest number of deaths per million people
- Analyzing the trend of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths over time
- Comparing the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths across different continents

# Results 
- Using Microsoft SQL Server for data exploration helped me gain valuable insights into the spread and impact of Covid-19. I was able to identify trends, patterns, and hotspots, and understand how the virus affected different countries and regions. These insights can help inform policy decisions and interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
